    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**  \n",

    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- **Encoder (CNN):** We use a pretrained ResNet-18, strip off the final classification layer, and freeze all its convolutional weights. We then add a linear projection from ResNet’s 512-dim feature vector to a lower-dimensional **embed_size** (256).  \n",
    "- **Decoder (RNN):** A single‐layer LSTM with input‐size = **embed_size** (256) and hidden‐state size = **hidden_size** (512), followed by a linear layer mapping hidden states to vocabulary logits. We prepend the image embedding as the “first word” to the LSTM input sequence.  \n",
    "- **Hyperparameter choices:**  \n",
    "  - **batch_size = 32:** Balances GPU memory use against gradient‐estimate stability.  \n",
    "  - **vocab_threshold = 5:** Discards very rare words to keep the vocabulary to a few thousand tokens (≈8 000), reducing overfitting and speeding up training.  \n",
    "  - **vocab_from_file = False:** We rebuild the vocab from scratch on first run to ensure consistency with chosen threshold.  \n",
    "  - **embed_size = 256:** Common in image‐captioning literature (e.g. 256–512).  \n",
    "  - **hidden_size = 512:** Provides the decoder enough capacity to model sentence structure without exploding parameter count.  \n",
    "  - **num_epochs = 3** and **save_every = 1:** Follows the Udacity rubric recommendation and gives multiple checkpoints for inspection.  \n",
    "  - **print_every = 100** and **log_file:** Defaults that allow us to monitor training loss and perplexity without overwhelming the notebook.  \n",

    "**How did you select the transform in `transform_train`? If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "We retained the provided pipeline because it matches the preprocessing used for ImageNet‐pretrained ResNet models:  \n",
    "1. **Resize(256)** → ensures the shorter edge is 256 px.  \n",
    "2. **RandomCrop(224)** → standard input size for ResNet; also acts as data augmentation.  \n",
    "3. **RandomHorizontalFlip()** → further augmentation to reduce overfitting.  \n",
    "4. **ToTensor() + Normalize(mean, std)** → scales pixels to [0, 1] and normalizes with ImageNet statistics (mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)).  \n",

    "**Question 3**  \n",
    "**How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture? Why do you think this is a good choice?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "We freeze the entire ResNet backbone (all convolutional layers) to leverage its pretrained visual features and avoid overfitting on COCO (given our limited compute). We only train:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters())\n",
    "```  \n",
    "- **`encoder.embed`** (the linear projection from 512→256)  \n",
    "- **All `decoder`** weights (embedding layer, LSTM, and output linear layer)  \n",
    "\n",
    "This focuses learning on adapting the image features to caption‐generation and keeps the bulk of ResNet fixed, which speeds up training and reduces the number of parameters to tune.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 4**  \n",
    "**How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "We chose **Adam** with a learning rate of **1 × 10⁻³**, because:  \n",
    "- Adam combines momentum and adaptive per‐parameter learning rates, which accelerates convergence in RNN‐based models.  \n",
    "- It is the de facto standard in many image‐captioning implementations (e.g. [Xu et al., 2015] uses Adam).  \n",
    "- Its default hyperparameters (β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999) work well out of the box, letting us get reasonable captions within 3 epochs without extensive optimizer tuning."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
